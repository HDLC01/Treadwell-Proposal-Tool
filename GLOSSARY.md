# Treadwell Proposal Tool

How Treadwell turns an inbound opportunity into a priced, customer-approved proposal for floor-coating and concrete-floor work, and tracks it until it is won, handed off or lost.

## Language

### Work

**Project**:
Everything Treadwell is pricing under one name and one address. A Project has at least one Scope.
_Avoid_: Draft, group, bid (as the unit)

**Scope**:
One separately priced, separately approvable piece of a Project, with its own Estimate and its own Proposal. An ordinary bid is a Project with a single Scope.
_Avoid_: Sibling, draft, room (a Scope may cover several rooms)

### Pricing and paperwork

**Estimate**:
The internal priced workbook for one Scope.
_Avoid_: Takeoff, sheet

**Proposal**:
The customer-facing document for one Scope, sent to the Customer through the portal.
_Avoid_: Quote

**Bid**:
The tax-inclusive price a Proposal offers for its Scope.
_Avoid_: Quote, lump sum

### People and pipelines

**Customer**:
Whoever receives and approves a Proposal: the owner on a Direct job, the general contractor on a GC job.
_Avoid_: Client

**Lead**:
An inbound opportunity that has not yet become a Project.
_Avoid_: Prospect

**Direct**:
The pipeline for Projects where the Customer is the owner.

**GC**:
The pipeline for Projects where the Customer is a general contractor.

### Outcomes

**Approved**:
The Customer has approved a Proposal.

**Won**:
A Scope that was marked won by hand, or approved with its deposit settled. A won job stays on the Active board until it is Handed off. Won is the stronger state: Approved alone does not make a Scope Won.

**Handed off**:
A won job that has been given to operations. This is the only outcome that takes a Won job off the Active board.

**Lost**:
A dead deal, whatever stage it died at. A job that was Won and then cancelled counts as Lost only.
